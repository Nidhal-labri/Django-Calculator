# Django-Calculator

I am not building a calculator app because I donâ€™t have one at home or because mine will be a sophisticated one. The purpose of creating this simple application is to improve my programming skills. Its importance becomes ever clearer in JavaScript, a language that is simple to learn but hard to master.
if we were to call it a day, how then will we include Python language as part of learning Python through building projects? Just as we mentioned in the first part of this project tutorial, we will use Django, a Python framework, to host this app.
